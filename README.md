### MacOS X idiosincracies

Alacritty doesn't want to pay the apple-fee, and they are right. Apple should
have, at least, a program for free software providing free, as in beer, signing
certificates.

Remove the quarantine:
`xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Alacritty.app`

### No more `divnix/hive`?

As it stands the hive is simply over-shadowing most of the simplicity of nix
flakes, a good alternative is to use Haumea to load lazy derivations and include
them in the submodules, it's not as /clean/ but the tracebacks are greatly
simplified. Also ... it's now _much_ faster.
